say for example I have a function a in c

and I have a main function int main(int argc, char const *argv[])

in function a, whats the difference when using exit(1); and return(1)


In C, `exit(1);` and `return(1);` are used to terminate a program, but they operate differently:

- `exit(1);`
  - **Terminates the entire program**: Regardless of where it is called, `exit` will terminate the program execution immediately.
  - **Does not return to the calling function**: After `exit` is called, the control does not return to the function that called the function where `exit` was invoked.
  - **Can be called from any function**: `exit` can be used in any function, not just `main`.
  - **Returns a status to the operating system**: The argument passed to `exit` (in this case, `1`) is returned to the operating system as the program's exit status.

- `return(1);`
  - **Returns control to the calling function**: If `return` is used in a function other than `main`, it will return control to the function that called it.
  - **Only terminates the current function**: `return` will only end the execution of the current function, not the entire program.
  - **In `main`, it ends the program**: When used in `main`, `return` will terminate the program since `main` is the entry point of the program.
  - **Returns a status to the operating system**: Similar to `exit`, the value returned by `main` (in this case, `1`) is used as the program's exit status.

In summary, `exit` is used to immediately end the program execution and return a status to the operating system, while `return` is used to end the execution of the current function and return control to the function that called it. When `return` is used in `main`, it also ends the program and returns a status to the operating system. The status code `1` typically indicates that the program terminated with an error.
